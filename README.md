Trapezius-Monster
=================

A little game that I develop to makes jokes of RenZhong. (in Chinese)

I've made several changes from the previous version.  
This game is currently **NOT** active for further updates due to my time limitation.  
But you can change the source code as you want. I just write it for fun.  

Requirements?
-----------------------
You need the following in your system:
* python 2.7
* pygame 1.9  

*may also work with older versions*

Notice:
pygame seems to work with 32bit python.   
So people using built-in 64bit python on **Mac** might check pygame site for how to handle this.  
My own experience is that simply download and install a new 32bit python on Mac.  

How to play?
-----------------------
The simplest way is to  
1.  Download the archive, unzip it into any directory you want.  
2.  Open a terminal on your computer  
3.  Type in  
        cd diretory\where\you\unzip\into    
        python trapezius_2.0.py

Ofcourse, you can use *git clone* command on Linux/Mac to replace step one.
You know how to do it.

Still got problems?
-------------------
If you still have problems or just don't want to install those mentioned requirements,  
drop me a message at [my Email addresss](schan.huang@gmail.com), I would try to pack you a(n) .exe/.dmg file.  
I also welcome any advices or ideas.  

Enjoy it!
