Trapezius-Monster
=================


  
A little game (in Chinese) that I develop to make jokes of RenZhong. 

I've made several changes from the previous version.  
This game is currently **NOT** active for further updates due to my time limitation.  
But you can change the source code as you want. I just write it for fun.  

Requirements
-----------------------
You will need the following in your system:
* python 2.7
* pygame 1.9  

*may also work with older versions*

**Notice:**  
Pygame seems to work only with 32bit python.
So people using built-in 64bit python on **Mac** may need to search Google for how to cope with this. 
In a nutshell, there is one command line to force MacPython run in 32bit or alternatively, you can simply download and install a new 32bit python on Mac.  

How to play?
-----------------------
The simplest way is to  
1.  Download the archive, unzip it into any directory you want.  
2.  Open a terminal on your computer  
3.  Type in

    cd diretory\where\you\unzip\into    
    python trapezius_2.0.py

Offcourse, you can use **git clone** command on Linux/Mac instead.
You know how to do it.

Contact me

Hope you enjoy it!
