Trapezius-Monster
=================


A little game (in Chinese) that I develop. Just for fun.

I've made several changes from the previous version.  
This game is currently not active for further updates.  
But you can change the source code as you want. I just write it for fun.  

Requirements
-----------------------
You will need the following in your system:
* python 2.7
* pygame 1.9  

*may also work with older versions*

**Notice:**  
Pygame seems to work only with 32bit python.
So people using built-in 64bit python on **Mac** may need to search Google for how to cope with this. 
In a nutshell, there is one command line to force MacPython run in 32bit or alternatively, you can simply download and install a new 32bit python on Mac.  

How to play?
-----------------------
If you have Python installed, just run

    python trapezius_2.0.py


Contact me
-------------------
If you still have problems or just don't want to install those mentioned requirements,  
drop me a message at schan.huang@gmail.com, I would try to pack you a(n) .exe/.dmg file with regard to your running system.  


Hope you enjoy it!
